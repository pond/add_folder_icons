      <h2>Managing SlipCover styles</h2>

      <p><a href="https://slipcover.en.softonic.com/mac"><strong>SlipCover</strong></a> by <strong>Bohemian Coding</strong>is a program that lets you make custom case icons for media files, such as home-made CDs, DVDs, Blu-Ray discs and so-on. It comes with various case designs built in, you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110619060724/http://bohemiancoding.com/slipcover/download/">download more from the Internet</a> or even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110619060859/http://bohemiancoding.com/slipcover/cases/">design your own from scratch</a>.</p>

      <p>Add Folder Icons lets you define styles which use SlipCover case designs, thanks to code generously donated by the SlipCover author. For more about this and other contributions, please see the "About" window, accessed from the "About Add Folder Icons" menu entry in the "Add Folder Icons" menu.</p>

      <p>In later versions of Mac OS X, <i>sandboxing</i> means that Add Folder Icons is not allowed to "see" the SlipCover application or read any of its case styles by default. If Add Folder Icons starts up and detects the presence of SlipCover but cannot access the case designs, it will pop up a file selector window asking you to grant access. You just click on the "Grant Access" button to proceed or, if you don't want SlipCover integration, cancel the window.</p>

      <p>Assuming you grant it access, then if Add Folder Icons detects the presence of any SlipCover case designs which it hasn't seen before, it will ask you if you want to automatically create styles for each of the case designs it has found.</p>

      </p>

      <p>You can also choose to add SlipCover based styles by hand at any time - <a href="help:anchor=styles bookID=uk.org.pond.Add-Folder-Icons.help">go to the Edit Style panel</a> and select "SlipCover cases" from the "Generate folder icons using:" menu at the top.</p>

      </p>

      <p>The menu underneath will be enabled and you can choose the case design from there.</p>

      <p>When you use SlipCover styles, Add Folder Icons uses pictures it considers to be cover art for the thumbnail, picking the first one that it finds. You can control how cover art is chosen using the <a href="help:anchor=preferences_advanced bookID=uk.org.pond.Add-Folder-Icons.help">advanced preferences</a>.

      <p>It is not possible to use a mixture of SlipCover and custom style parameters; you must choose one or the other.</p>

      <p>If you ever delete a SlipCover case design which has an associated Add Folder Icons style, Add Folder Icons will be forced to delete that style as it is no longer valid. It will warn you when this happens.</p>
