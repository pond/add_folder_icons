      <h2>What does Add Folder Icons do?</h2>

      <p>Ordinary folders in the Mac OS X Finder are always displayed with the same boring old blue folder icon.</p>

      </p>

      <p>Sometimes you might want to liven this up. Perhaps you browse a music collection through the Finder as well as in iTunes, or have photos that you browse in the Finder as well as in iPhoto. You might create artwork, or own a collection of home movie DVD files. Whatever things you have, one thing is for sure &mdash; the standard blue folder icon doesn't give you many clues about the folder's contents.</p>

      <p>This is where Add Folder Icons comes in. It uses any pictures found inside a given folder to create a customised icon based on a configurable <em>icon style</em>. There is a set of built-in icon styles and you can create your own.</p>

      <p>In the example below, the first two rows of folders have a preset style applied and the bottom row has a customised style applied.</p>

      </p>

      <p>Add Folder Icons can treat all pictures equally as in the examples above, or search for pictures which it treats as special cover art files. This gives good results with movies, music collections and so-on.</p>

      </p>

      <p>Customised folder icons work well for general browsing in the Finder and look great in Cover Flow view. In addition to its own icon creation settings, Add Folder Icons integrates with <a href="https://slipcover.en.softonic.com/mac"><strong>SlipCover</strong></a> by <strong>Bohemian Coding</strong>, to offer almost limitless possibilities for customisation.</p>
