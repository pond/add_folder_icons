Many thanks to the following individuals and organisations whose community and individual contributions have made this application possible.\
\
SlipCover ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/31676/slipcover"}}{\fldrslt \ul \ulc2 https://slipcover.en.softonic.com/mac}}) integration is achieved by source code kindly donated by 
\f1\b Pieter Omvlee
\f0\b0 , {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://x.com/pieteromvlee"}}{\fldrslt \ul \ulc2 http://x.com/pieteromvlee}}. He has given permission for it to be released with Add Folder Icons and covered by the Add Folder Icons licence conditions.\
\
Folder monitoring uses 
\f1\b \cf0 Stuart Connolly's
\f0\b0 \cf2  SCEvents Objective C wrapper (now only available from forks such ast {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://github.com/mz2/SCEvents"}}{\fldrslt https://github.com/mz2/SCEvents}}) around the FSEvents framework. This falls under an MIT licence which is compatible with the Add Folder Icons licence conditions.\
\
The clickable link label in the style editor was made easy thanks to the "DSClickableURLTextField" class by 
\f1\b \cf0 Michael Nickerson
\f0\b0 \cf2  ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://web.archive.org/web/20090830144511/http://www.nightproductions.net/developer.htm"}}{\fldrslt https://web.archive.org/web/20090830144511/http://www.nightproductions.net/developer.htm}}). This has no specific licence but simply says "can be used freely", provided the source code retains its copyright message. Please see the Add Folder Icons source code ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://hipposoft.pond.org.uk/"}}{\fldrslt \cf0 \ul \ulc0 http://hipposoft.pond.org.uk/}}) for details.\
\
Portions of the preferences system are based on the idea of "DBPrefsWindowController" by 
\f1\b Dave Batton
\f0\b0 , now only available from forks such as {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://github.com/kgn/DBPrefsWindowController"}}{\fldrslt \ul \ulc2 https://github.com/kgn/DBPrefsWindowController}}. The Add Folder Icons implementation was created anew so that it could fall under the Add Folder Icons licence conditions.\
